## Introduction

Wine quality classification is a challenging task that combines data exploration, cleaning, model training, and evaluation. In this project, we use the `winequality-red.csv` dataset—which includes various chemical properties of red wines—to predict their quality ratings. Several machine learning models are implemented and compared to achieve this goal.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `winequality-red.csv`. It contains the following key features:
- **Fixed Acidity**
- **Volatile Acidity**
- **Citric Acid**
- **Residual Sugar**
- **Chlorides**
- **pH**
- **Sulphates**
- **Alcohol**
- **Quality** (target variable)

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open the Notebook:

Open the Wine Quality Data.ipynb file to access the complete workflow.

Execute the Notebook Cells:

Run each cell sequentially to load data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

Methodology
The analysis is structured into the following steps:

Data Loading:
Reading the dataset using Pandas and previewing the data to understand its structure.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Generating statistical summaries and visualizations to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships within the data.

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning the data, handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing the dataset for model training.

Model Training:
Implementing several machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to predict wine quality.
The models are trained and validated to compare their performance.

Model Evaluation:
Assessing the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Data Visualization
The analysis includes various visualizations to support the insights derived from the data. Below is an example of a key visualization output:

Results
The notebook presents a comprehensive evaluation of different models. Key findings include:

Comparative performance metrics for each model.

Insights on how various physicochemical properties impact wine quality.

Visualizations that demonstrate model accuracy and potential areas for improvement.

Future Work
Further enhancements for this project could include:

Hyperparameter tuning through cross-validation to optimize model performance.
