# Wine Quality Classification

This project analyzes red wine quality using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict wine quality based on its physicochemical properties, such as acidity, sugar, pH, and more. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and documentation.

## Introduction

Wine quality classification is an interesting challenge that combines data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model evaluation. In this project, we explore different techniques for predicting wine quality, comparing algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is winequality-red.csv, which contains various chemical properties of red wines and their corresponding quality ratings. Some key features include:
- *Fixed Acidity*
- *Volatile Acidity*
- *Citric Acid*
- *Residual Sugar*
- *Chlorides*
- *pH*
- *Sulphates*
- *Alcohol*
