## Introduction

Wine quality classification is a challenging task that combines data exploration, cleaning, model training, and evaluation. In this project, we use the `winequality-red.csv` dataset—which includes various chemical properties of red wines—to predict their quality ratings. Several machine learning models are implemented and compared to achieve this goal.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `winequality-red.csv`. It contains the following key features:
- **Fixed Acidity**
- **Volatile Acidity**
- **Citric Acid**
- **Residual Sugar**
- **Chlorides**
- **pH**
- **Sulphates**
- **Alcohol**
- **Quality** (target variable)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-classification.git
    cd wine-quality-classification

2. **Install the Required Packages:**

Install the necessary packages manually:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter

## Usage

To run the analysis:
1. ** Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook

2. **Open the Notebook:**

Open the Wine Quality Data.ipynb file to access the complete workflow.

3. **Execute the Notebook Cells:**

Run each cell sequentially to load data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## Methodology
The analysis is structured into the following steps:

**Data Loading:**
Reading the dataset using Pandas and previewing the data to understand its structure.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Generating statistical summaries and visualizations to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships within the data.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Cleaning the data, handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing the dataset for model training.

**Model Training:**
Implementing several machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to predict wine quality.
The models are trained and validated to compare their performance.

**Model Evaluation:**
Assessing the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The notebook presents a comprehensive evaluation of different models. Key findings include:

Comparative performance metrics for each model.

Insights on how various physicochemical properties impact wine quality.

Visualizations that demonstrate model accuracy and potential areas for improvement.

## Future Work
Further enhancements for this project could include:

Hyperparameter tuning through cross-validation to optimize model performance.

Exploring additional machine learning or ensemble methods.

Incorporating more advanced feature engineering techniques.

Experimenting with deep learning approaches for enhanced predictive performance.
